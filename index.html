        <p>I love books! It may sound strange, but I really do. Ever since I was a little girl I've read a lot of books.
            My mother even used to ask me questions about the book I was reading, because she thought I read
            too fast to understand anything. But I could always retell the story. I really love to drift away into the
            fantasyworld of a book. This is what I think is the best about reading but there are other advantages
            about reading., let me describe a few.</p>
        <p> To begin with it's very relaxing. You can sit down at a quiet place and just forget about the world
            around you for a while. Sometimes when I feel like I have a million things to do I take a
            break, make a cup of tea and cuddle up in the corner of the sofa with a good book. After just a little
            while of reading I've got my strength up to take care of everything. It's also a great way to calm down
            before going to bed. </p>
